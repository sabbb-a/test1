# hello!
# this project, based on the concept of a music searching app, was made by students Duc Vinh (Steven) Lam and Sabrina Amoura
# in this repository, you will find:

# - ZIP FILES
# of which, "Final Project (Finalized).zip" is our latest rendition and basically our submission for this project.
# "Final Project.zip" and "Final Project Color.zip" are two previous versions of the project.

# - RETIREDCLASSES FOLDER
# The retired classes folder contains all of the classes that we had previously worked on, but decided were not needed for the final version of the project.
# Typically, these classes were either renamed, or even, multiple of them were consolidated into one.

# - JAVA FILES
# "Finder.java", "Game.java", "Level.java", "Main.java", "Playlist.java", and "Song.java", are the files that make up our source code.
# These are the files that we worked on and made updates to continuously throughout the process.
